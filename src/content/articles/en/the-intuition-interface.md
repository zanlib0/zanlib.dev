What does a product engineer even do?

I've recently been asked about what product engineering means _to me_, and while I _knew_ the answer, I had considerable trouble articulating it. The term gets thrown around a lot but it is rarely examined, and if it is examined, it's usually reduced to a number of platitudes like "cares about the result, not the tools," as if software engineers didn't care about the result.

When we talk about the different _technical_ roles of a software project, we typically consider them on a spectrum from high-level to low-level, depending on how close to the user or how close to the machine someone works. At the high-level we might have front-end developers, web designers and <abbr>UX/UI</abbr> designers. A bit further down we might look at back-end developers, database administrators, infrastructure and site reliability engineers, embedded software developers, and so on.

Sometimes these roles are lumped together under a new label, for instance, one who combines the skill set of a back-end and front-end engineer and perhaps some database administration might be called a "full-stack engineer," or one who deals with infrastructure, databases and back-end comes to be defined as a "DevOps engineer."

Likewise, when we consider _non-technical_ roles we also tend to place them on a spectrum of those that are closest to the product to those that are closest to the stakeholders: business analysts, project managers, product owners are some of the labels employed here, and here too roles are frequently merged: one taking on the responsibilities and skills of both a project manager and a product owner might come to be called a "product manager."

The more complicated software becomes, the more roles are created and the more responsibilities are extracted. That said, we very rarely see the two worlds, technical and non-technical, merge, and they are rarely considered as a whole. There is a good reason for it: we tend to think of the non-technical world as the ones who set the goals, and of the technical world as the ones who execute these goals.[+hattip]

[+hattip]: This separation is quite obvious when you consider it from the outside, but it seems like many of us rarely consider what the software development field _looks like_ from the outside. I've been in this field for a while now, and I only realised this while listening to [a podcast about investing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePPWdUY0aLc).

But in my view, that separation, like [many](/blog/romantic-programming) is entirely artificial. We can lay every role, from the users themselves down to the most heads-down technical engineers on a spectrum from man to machine and within each part of this fractal, there will be those who set goals and those who execute them.

The two can even be the same person.
