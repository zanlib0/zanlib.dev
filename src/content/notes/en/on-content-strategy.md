title: On Content Strategy
pubDate: 9 Nov 2025

When I was still writing on [Inter Caetera](https://intercaetera.com) I strived to make sure that everything I write is of very high quality, all the published thoughts are polished, edited, typeset... In short that everything has a lot of effort put into it.

While I still commit to high quality, there are a lot of things that lie unfinished - book notes, incomplete thoughts, scribbles on paper. Some of these things end up in different places, as Reddit comments or X tweets. However, that is not ideal: I want everything meaningful to end up on my site, while still publishing appropriately high quality articles.

So here, the strategy is different: each post belongs to one of three categories:

- *Articles* - These are "proper" articles, that have been thoroughly researched, are appropriately edited, translated to both English and Polish if possible and very unlikely to change in the future. Used for polished thoughts. The same kind of quality you would have seen on the <abbr>IC</abbr> blog. Typeset in serif (makes it seem serious), and rigorously following the style guide.

- *Notes* - These are, well, notes on various subjects. I started doing this on Inter Caetera where articles that would start with the word "On" are those notes. The idea here is that I have a few things that I am usually working on in Obisidan that are not polished but could already be helpful to someone. These could be on various subjects, ranging from professional to personal, that I find are worth publishing but are not as polished as Articles. Typeset in sans-serif.

- *Jots* - these are completely "dirty" notes, single sentences, lists, tweet-long content that would be a stub of a bigger idea in the future. Untitled, and deliberately typeset in ugly monospace. Also perhaps unpolished book notes, lists of quotes, things like that. Completely scrapbook material. Whenever I feel the temptation to give a title to a Jot, that means it should probably be promoted to a Note.

The idea here is that jots could progress to become notes, notes could progress to becoming articles.
